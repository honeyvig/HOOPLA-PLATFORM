# HOOPLA-PLATFORM
To approach the task of calculating the "total job cost" for the development and updates of the HOOPLA platform, here is a breakdown of the steps required, along with the roles and the effort estimations for the team involved.
Key Areas to Address:

    Team Roles and Responsibilities
        Frontend Technology: Vue.js (2 developers)
        The frontend team will be responsible for updating the user interface (UI), implementing features like dynamic components, ensuring smooth user experience (UX), and integrating with the backend.
        Backend Technology: Laravel (4 developers)
        The backend team will focus on handling database logic, APIs, business logic, authentication, and ensuring that the platform performs optimally on the server side.
        Testing Team (1 quick fix tester, 1 automated tester)
        The testing team will ensure that any issues are addressed in real-time and automate regression tests to ensure stability during and after the update.

    Team Structure
        Frontend Developer (Vue.js): 2 developers working on creating, maintaining, and enhancing the frontend interface using Vue.js.
        Backend Developer (Laravel): 4 developers working on enhancing APIs, implementing new features, and ensuring proper data management with Laravel.
        Testers:
            1 Quick Fix Tester: To test and report issues that need immediate resolution.
            1 Automated Tester: To create and run tests that verify functionality and perform regression testing on the platform.

    Work Breakdown
        Initial Setup & Familiarization (1-2 weeks): The new team will need time to familiarize themselves with the existing platform architecture, project requirements, and codebase.
        Frontend Tasks (Ongoing): Enhancements, bug fixes, new feature implementation, and UI adjustments based on user feedback.
        Backend Tasks (Ongoing): Adding new features, improving database architecture, optimizing API performance, and ensuring security measures are updated.
        Testing (Ongoing): Writing test cases, performing manual tests for immediate issues, and running automated tests for stability.

    Estimating the Total Job Cost
        Hourly Rates: The cost will depend on the hourly rates for developers and testers. Here's an estimated breakdown (example rates can be adjusted based on the region, experience, and skillset):
            Frontend Developer (Vue.js): $40–$100/hour.
            Backend Developer (Laravel): $50–$120/hour.
            Tester (Quick Fix): $30–$60/hour.
            Tester (Automated): $40–$80/hour.
        Effort Estimation:
            Assuming a 60-hour per week contract for the 90-day trial period:
                Frontend Team (2 developers): 2 developers × 60 hours/week × 12 weeks = 1,440 hours.
                Backend Team (4 developers): 4 developers × 60 hours/week × 12 weeks = 2,880 hours.
                Testing Team (2 testers): 2 testers × 60 hours/week × 12 weeks = 1,440 hours.
        Total estimated hours = 5,760 hours.

    Total Cost Calculation (Based on Example Rates):
        Frontend Team: 1,440 hours × $70 (avg. rate) = $100,800.
        Backend Team: 2,880 hours × $85 (avg. rate) = $244,800.
        Testing Team: 1,440 hours × $50 (avg. rate) = $72,000.

    Total Estimated Job Cost for 90-day trial = $417,600.

    Contractual Agreement:
        After the 90-day trial, if the team performance is satisfactory, the contract can be extended for a 1-year full-time agreement based on performance.
        A detailed breakdown and milestones should be established for payments, based on team progress and deliverables.

Key Proposal Points:

    Team Composition: 2 frontend developers, 4 backend developers, 2 testers.
    90-Day Trial: Focus on immediate tasks like bug fixes, new feature implementation, and performance enhancement.
    1-Year Full-Time Contract: Based on performance, with deliverables and goals to be outlined for the extended term.

This approach ensures that the team understands the scope of work, timeline, and cost estimates, and allows flexibility to adjust as the project progresses.
